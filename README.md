This repository contains projects to cover basic cmake usages and features. The
knowledge is basically from the book "Professional CMake".

To unified the usage of each project, some make targets are available for all.

make project: create the project in a separate directory

make build: build the project's targets

make run: executes the built application

make clear: removes all projects and build artifacts by removing the build directory
